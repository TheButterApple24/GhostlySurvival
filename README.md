# GhostlySurvival
Survive hordes of ghosts in an ever changing arena. Every 10 seconds the arena will change and you must adapt your play-style in order to survive. 

This was created for Ludum Dare 51. This was created in my own custom Game Engine. This is also my very first game I have released using this engine (and in general) so I'm sorry for any bugs or issues! Feel free to post any bugs/issues or comments below! This game is free to download but if you want to help support my game development journey than I would appreciate it!
